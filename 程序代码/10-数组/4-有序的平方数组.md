      给你一个按 非递减顺序 排序的整数数组 nums，返回 每个数字的平方 组成的新数组，要求也按 非递减顺序 排序。



      示例 1：

      输入：nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
      输出：[0,1,9,16,100]
      解释：平方后，数组变为 [16,1,0,9,100]
      排序后，数组变为 [0,1,9,16,100]

        '''
        1、非递减
        2、求平方
        
        解决两个问题： 
        由于其中元素有正有负：
        1、负数的平方可能大于正数的平方
        2、非递减---递增
        
        思路： 按照绝对值排序
